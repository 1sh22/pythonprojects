A collection of simple python projects from beginner to Advanced level to enhance your Python skills.

## Steps To Follow

- Select an issue and ask to be _assigned_ to it.
- Check existing scripts in the Repo
- **Star** this repository.
- On the [pythonprojects](https://github.com/sumukhmg/pythonprojects) repo page, click the **Fork** button.

- **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.

 For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/pythonprojects.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

	Learn more about
 [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and 
 [cloning a repo]
 (https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
 
- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
  Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.

	Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code _to your repository_.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

	Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and
 **make a pull request**:

    ![pull request image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)

    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- Now wait, until one of us *reviews your Pull Request*! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
